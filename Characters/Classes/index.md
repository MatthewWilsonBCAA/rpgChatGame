# Classes

Classes are both vanity and metadata for a character. They define a characters attributes, and partially personality and style. The following is an overview of classes:

## Warrior

Trained in a particular way of fighting, they are the standard military unit, capable of using one weapon well and effectively. They don't cower in the face of danger, which may lead to their premature death

### Archer 

A subclass of __Warrior__, they are trained to use a bow and arrow. Their main goal is not accuracy, but to get as many arrows in the enemy as possible.

#### Bowman 

A subclass of __Archer__.

### Paladin 

A subclass of __Warrior__, they depend on outlasting the enemy in drawn out combat.

### Knight

A subclass of __Warrior__, their main standard is honor, and hold to it like it is their life (In many cases it is).

## Barbarian

A __Barbarian__ is the general economical and political outcast, living in poverty or shunning. They are not all bad, but most fall to the lowest standards possible.
