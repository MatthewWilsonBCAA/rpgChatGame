# Traps

For traps, a chance of avoidance is provided as follows:

  1. Take any related stats such as dexterity, accuracy, or intelligance.
  2. Find the sum.
  3. Divide by the number of related stats, or the minimum 2.
  4. Add to 50.
  5. Roll a percentile dice. If it's lower than the result, they evade or don't set off the trap.
